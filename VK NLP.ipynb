However, those do so much worse than the people who work on the startup full-time that going back to school seems, in practice, not too far removed from a death sentence for a startup.Off the top of my head, I\\'d guess we\\'ve had about 8 startups where the founders went back to school.  It doesn\\'t only happen with summer batches.  Founders from winter batches do it too.Usually the reason is that the startup isn\\'t doing very well. However, that judgement depends a lot on how determined the founders are.  One reason we now shy away from funding people still in school is that they often unconsciously want the startup to fail, because the idea of dropping out frightens them.A lot of startups look bad after 3 months.

Hangul is a language that was designed by a small group of advisors when the royalty realized most koreans were illiterate (not enough resources to spend learning chinese kanji). How the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple, in fact, turned out to be simple? Some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post WWII and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique Korean culture. Additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average Korean still uses 700-800 Chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). He crucifies Joel and Don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers. The Japanese katakana alphabet can represent many words very well... until you try to do one with an L in it, and then it fails utterly. Using one contrived example wouldn\\'t reveal that, and its the same reason I doubt his point about hangul.\\nBeyond technicalities, its ignorant to conflate the creation of one small group of individuals six hundred years ago with the cultural preferences of modern Korea.

The only way for projects like that to come to fruition in any reasonable amount of time is for people to work long hours.The nature of software startups has changed. With web apps, the code base is relatively small and simple. There usually isn't a compile cycle. What happens now, is you spend all your time on systems administration issues.

I joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  It was profitable, I liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.Overall, I would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   Some observations:The language choice will grate on you after a while.  I dunno what the background of posters saying \"Be professional.  Suck it up.\" is, but I actually liked Java coding when I started, and have since learned to hate it.  If you\\'re going in with a strong aversion to Java &#38; C++ already, it\\'ll probably only get worse.Flip side is that you do get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  There are tricks and tools in C++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn\\'t be tracing pointers from new to delete.  And Java\\'s verbosity isn\\'t as bad once you get used it and consider \"for(int i = 0; i &#60; array.length; ++i)....\" to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)One question to ask that\\'ll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language\\'s strengths, or are they using it because they don\\'t know any better and aren\\'t comfortable with multi-language solutions?  Every mainstream language is good for something.  In my case, I was perfectly happy as long as I was writing IDE plugins and server software in Java, and then became very unhappy once I had to write a webapp.  (IMNSHO, Java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the JavaEE bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that\\'s nowhere near as nice as Python/PHP/Perl.)There are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  OTOH, it\\'s not rocket science.  Basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) Make something people want, 2.) Charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) Fix problems now rather than later.  Every failed startup I\\'ve been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.I dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  At least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  One startup I worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  One that I interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; I did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40M exit, I would get a whole $4000.  I have no equity at my current employer.  My cubemate was an early employee at CCBN, which was sold to Thomson for about $40M.  He got $3K or so.  I have another friend who was employee #35 at Stratus and later a VP; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  If you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.',\n",

I think much of the negativism stems from the hacker mentality that big companies are evil and that breaking the rules is cool. Therefore anything that big companies do or use is automatically uncool.Nothing wrong with this mindset, but I think it often goes too far with some. Java and C++ are not bad languages. Yes, most large software companies use them but there are some reasons why they might be a desirable choice. One is that these languages work well in a collaborative work environment. There are many proven debugging tools, established QA practices, very good IDEs with integrated revision synchronization tools, etc. While these may not matter for the hacker or small group of hackers creating something cool, they are very important considerations for a growing software company who has plans to scale.So with this understanding in mind I wouldn\\'t automatically rule out a company based on the fact they code in C++/Java.

The in-person failures we experienced were of the FizzBuzz variety, not the \"I don\\'t exactly under stand concurrency\" sort.So, we started asking people to read some code and comment on it.  Really basic Java stuff: Will this code compile?  Trace the flow of execution through this method if the BlahException was thrown.  String comparisons with ==.  The idea was to see if (1) the person was at all clueful, and (2) if they had actually written Java code.  As the linked blogger noted, the disparity in responses is shocking. We found that about half the people we interviewed thought that execution of a Java method ceased once a catch block had been entered.  Half!  How could they ever have written robust production code?  These were often people with years of Java experience on their resumes.  I just don\\'t understand how someone could write a bunch of Java code and not understand the basics of how exceptions work.Some other parts of the code review were more nuanced.  Most candidates knew that one should not compare strings using double equals, but they usually couldn\\'t explain why.  Nor did they understand why == sometimes seems to work when comparing a referenced String object to a literal.

If I accept the offer, my EXPECTED return jumps from $500k to $5M (10% of $50M) -- but there's no way that I'd accept the offer, because I really don't want to spend years of my life on something which has a 90% chance of being worthless.It's important to understand the numbers, but in the end the numbers, at best, have to guide you rather than making decisions for you.\",\n",

Lighttpd can do a few things: it does fast cgi (fcgi support explains about 75% of the examples in that list), it can serve static files, and it can proxy requests to other servers. Lighttpd doesn\\'t \"support Mongrel\", because Mongrel is another server. What Lighttpd does is use something akin to mod_proxy to send certain requests somewhere else, that somewhere else might be a Mongrel cluster that is running on port 8080 (hence it \"supports\" Mongrel).\\nThat proxying service is where the majority of Lighttpd usage has been. A typical efficient setup these days (YouTube does along these lines) is to have lighttpd accept incoming requests and if the request is for a static file then it serves the request (because it is very lightweight (i.e. minimal) it is more efficient than Apache at serving static media), and if it is for dynamic content the request is passed to Apache, which then passes it back to Lighttpd, which passes it back to the requester (this means that \"heavy\" Apache threads will be dedicated to a request for a shorter period of time since it only has to communicate/wait for Lighttpd instead of the actual requester).\\nLighttpd on its own isn\\'t necessarily the best solution (an example from my experience is that mod_python and Apache become more efficient at serving dynamic content than fcgi and Lighttpd as the numbers of requester per second get very high). Usually a combination of a light frontend server and Apache in the backend can provide the best performance (again this is at high numbers, at lower numbers lighttpd is probablly equally or more efficient).\\nAs a final note, I\\'d really recommend Nginx over Lighttpd if you are looking for a light http server to serve static content, support fcgi, and/or proxy to other servers. The biggest reason? Lighttpd leaks memory and has to be restarted occasionally because every couple of days (under heavy usage) it dies. Not a great feature in a production server.',\n",
       " \"The big win of lighttpd/nginx is that they're single-process [1] multiplexing servers. Apache spawns dozens (or hundreds) of processes/threads and relies on the OS to distribute resources.

So, keep that in mind when reading my comments below.This is an idea I've heard before. I agree that everything in the world is going to the web. File systems will become distributed. Every application you use will come from the internet, with the exception of your kernel and the software needed to retrieve the applications. They'll probably run remotely, too, and just send you the graphics/UI.However, I think that turning the web browser into a window manager is going in the wrong direction. It completely disobeys the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well. Firefox's role in the future should be rendering and running remote applications. Organizing the apps using tabs, MDI, windows, workspaces, viewports, etc. should be left to the people who are spending all of their time thinking about how to organize applications.\",\n",
       " 'I think when you say \"firefox os\" you really mean \"browser-based UI for Linux,\" right? You are already supposing that Linux (an actual operating system) exists underneath.Isn\\'t Internet Explorer + Windows Explorer + Web Folders pretty much doing this already? Windows\\' Web Folders feature lets you store documents remotely and access them over HTTP from regular (non-web-enabled) applications. Internet Explorer lets you browse the local filesystem and the web from the same browser window pretty seamlessly.It seems that Firefox is indeed becoming an application deployment platform. However, it doesn\\'t seem like a good idea to me. Instead of having one package manager in the operating system, there will be two: one system package manage and one Firefox package manager. There are all kinds of security and manageability problems with that. Already, there are many buggy Firefox plugins that cripple the browser, effectively causing a DOS attack with crashes and decreased performance. This is a good indication that we should not have confidence in Firefox\\'s abilities to manage third party applications. Really Firefox should be in that business at all, since resource allocation and crash prevention are fundamentally operating system features. The right solution is to improve the installation experience provided by the operating system, and have it provide security-oriented integration capabilities for applications (as opposed to to the performance-oriented integration capabilities we have now). This would require the operating system to provide a sandboxed environment by default to downloaded applications. The OS needs to provide a middle ground between the almost unrestricted access given to today\\'s downloaded applications, and the totally restricted access given to web apps; that access needs to be very close to the web app side.With this kind of severely-limited sandbox, we can then eliminate the whole UI of application installation.

I came to the conclusion that since Paul was a published author of Lisp books at the time, and saw an opportunity to use it in production (maybe to gain experience and write another book about it to share his findings with others) but ended up learning about startups, dot coms, investors, and users as well, he instead wrote essays on paulgraham.com and used some of them in his Hackers and Painters book.I dare say his essays are about starting up in general, and there is no secret plan to convert users into using Lisp.  Every week on YCombinator Startup News, somebody asks about learning Lisp to do a web app, when there are way more other things to worry about than the language.  Use something you want to use every day, not just in theory because someone else did.  I'd learn an unknown language if I was at a startup that used it every day, but otherwise, I would default to using a web framework that I have already used in the past.My conclusion is that if you're creating a web application using a web framework in any language you find interesting at the moment, go for it.  Because that's exactly what Paul did.  It just happened to be Lisp that he was an expert at, but it could have been any other exciting technology.Whether Paul would use Lisp today or not on a new project is irrelevant as far as your plate is concerned.  He could use Lisp, but it wouldn't mean that there aren't other good alternatives.  And if he did use a language other than Lisp, maybe it would be so because he would want to learn web framework since he wouldn't be writing Lisp books any more, but Lisp may still be something he would normally use more often.I think this is a great question.\",\n",

As a result, the most creative ideas are shot down before they are given a chance to be refined.Instead, if you generate ideas on your own you can spend more time on a half-baked concept in order to round out its flaws.

One thing I noticed time and time again in all these places is the prevalence of 'internal marketing'. When stripped of trendy buzzwords and platitudes about 'empowerment', internal marketing is a De facto ideology which stipulates that marketing is the primary driving force in every organization. It places product quality, customer value, and strategy in a distant secondary position. The problem with marketing companies is that their myopic focus produces reactionary organizations - more ad hoc institutions than enterprises. 'Marketing companies' are sometimes profitable, but rarely maintain a commanding market position for long if they get there in the first place. Contrast these with the real product companies of our time: Apple, Google, Craigslist, Facebook, Toyota. The real profit and value are being created by companies who focus on actual products. Some of these companies have little marketing apparatus at all, at least in the sense you're talking about. This reminds me of a silly aphorism: You rob a bank because that's where the money is.

When they were kids, a new toy was a truly wonderful gift, and so they continue to give them.And yet their houses were relatively cheap relative to their incomes. For 20 and 30-ish people, the great financial challenge is housing, not plastic toys.  So stuff is very cheap, but a place to put that stuff is prohibitively expensive.

After 15 years in the US, she still worries about leaving her stuff in the laundromat.I\\'ve been thinking about the subject a lot over the years and Paul\\'s essay is spot-on.  The more money I make, the more I dislike \"stuff\".  I hardly bought anything since I started my first job after college.  In contrast I used to buy a fair amount of junk before.  My room was always cluttered and I hated being at home because I felt like the stuff drained all my energy.It\\'s true that stuff owns people and not the other way around.  My neighbor in Cambridge, MA keeps a backyard (more like a junkyard) full of used construction materials and equipment, including 3 dead trucks.  He spends every single evening trying to straighten it out, but ends up just wheelbarrowing stuff from place to place without any noticeable progress.  I, on the other hand, am now able to spend every evening working on my startup, and not having stuff makes me feel great!',\n",
       " \"Starting a startup has led to big improvements for me in this area. Back when I worked for other people I was constantly buying stuff. Oh, the rationalizations I came up with for purchases of very dubious value. I felt that I had to have every piece of the puzzle, only I didn't realize that the puzzle can never be completed.Now that I've gone out on my own I don't have the time or money to spend like this anymore. It's such a change for the better.Here are some stuff-reduction techniques I use:Books: I have one large Ikea bookshelf. Several of the shelves are reserved as a 'rotating collection' - when the shelf gets full, I make myself sell some books on Amazon before I get new ones. The collection can never exceed the capacity of the one decent-sized bookshelf.Every August, I take an inventory of everything I own and how often I'm using it. This includes books, clothes, office supplies, everything. Everything gets divided into three categories based on usage: heavily used, not used at all, and marginal. I keep everything in the 'heavily used' category. I sell, give away, or throw away everything in the 'never used' category. Then, I make a list of everything in the 'marginal' category and keep it until the next year. If any given item is still 'marginal' the next year, I sell it.You'd be surprised how effective this is. What's especially amazing is the crazy stuff you can sell over the net - someone paid 50 bucks for a t-shirt I hadn't worn in 15 years. Last year I made enough cash doing this to buy a new Mac. The reduction in clutter is even better.\",\n",

Stick with what you have, and you have to work with a codebase that makes development a nightmare (otherwise you wouldn\\'t consider rewriting).Better to avoid it if possible - do a bit of planning upfront, refactor when you can, have enough tests that refactoring is safe.At my last job we rewrote a large part of the application - but it was done piecemeal, over two years, and never halted development or delayed new features.  Refactoring was \"snuck in\" as part of deliverables whenever it was possible and safe.

The existing code just wouldn't allow this, even if it were stretched and stretched.So I rewrote most of the codebase.In some ways I was tortured knowing we had a functioning product that already handled things I was rewriting (even though it was on an obsolete platform).  Especially since the rewriting process takes longer than zero.On the other hand, the new set of code turned out smaller, simpler, more reliable, much more flexible, and is now working well as a foundation our for business.Both sides of the argument make sense to me, I think it just depends on the situation.\",\n",

Unless the company in question has open sourced their code and allows anyone to use it under some kind of a BSD-like license, you have absolutely no right to use that code or IP.Not only are both of these cases illegal, they're also highly unethical. Also, if you're forming a company around someone else's IP, you're gonna crash and burn.When I worked as a contractor, I would use my own libraries to save me some time but before I used them, I notified the management that I was using them and told them that I own the code and that I give them full right to use it without any licensing fees and I also told them I would use them on my other contracting jobs. They always accepted these stipulations an I've never had any problems. They loved the fact that I was not wasting my time and their money re-implementing the wheel and that I was solving their problems in record time. The key is to be open and put it all on the table before you start working.Also, after I'd finish working on a project and if I was using my own computer, I'd wipe my computer clean of all of their code. I would do that on the last day of my job and I ALWAYS made sure that someone from the management was there to witness it. Sure, that might be going overboard but trust me... it's worth it.

Or for that matter, even US$100 Million.  That is why there is little talk about taking the majority of them public, because other than as a delivery vector for advertisements, there is scarce value in this crop of startups.  To be perfectly frank, these are less than ideal platforms for ad delivery as well.What can be done?  We can try other models, and I\\'m sure many will.  There are a boatload of virtual worlds, virtual world platforms, and MMOs coming on line this fall.  ALL of them plan on using ads, microtransactions, and subscriptions.

If Facebook\\'s users all left the site tomorrow, it would obviously be bad for Facebook, but the rest of the industry would break out the champagne. Users who leave Facebook don\\'t abandon the Web and join the Amish - they go someplace else online, and the ad revenue goes right along with them.

One could argue that the industry is funding, or is about to fund, many more ad-based companies than the ecosystem can support at the moment. But even that would not constitute a \"bubble\".

For people who have the ability, this can take the form of scientific achievement, or entrepreneurship, or arts or music.  For people who don\\'t have the ability to succeed in \"socially acceptable\" fields, it usually takes the form of crime.

We put in our sweat first and foremost and happen to invest sufficient capital as well.  We only invest our time and money where we can add value. \\n2.\\tWe offer deep business development and technical skills and an extensive network.  We work as the extended team so the startup can stay small but still have the right quality and quantity of talent.3.\\tWe love the YC approach of supporting entrepreneurs and drew inspiration from their model.  That being said, there are some key differences.  Namely, we get actively involved in each business. We invest funds to carry the company for two years to a potential exit or to a high growth trajectory. And, like YC, we leave open the possibility of a small, early acquisition as exit.  As we all know, this is a likely outcome these days, even though the VCs don\\'t like them.4.\\tBecause of our involvement we can get involved with founders whose plans are still nascent, and sometimes we\\'ll help put founders together on a business. To us the entrepreneurs are more important than the idea itself.5.\\tWe typically look for technical founders who have a knack for understanding what their users want and then delivering it quickly.  We don\\'t encourage outsourcing development unless it\\'s just for commodity components of the overall service.6.\\tWe don\\'t consider anyone a \"reject\" because a fund passed them by.  We\\'ll evaluate each team and business on its own merits and go for it if we like the people, think we can add a lot of value, and believe we can build a valuable business together.

Why did Reddit and Digg descend into their present state?I think something other than \"the userbase has grown\" is going on here. I think one major reason is that you see others\\' opinions before you decide your own. As a general rule, any Internet poll prompts you to vote before showing you the running results, to attempt to preserve independence of opinion. Reddit and Digg, however, breach this.Secondly, in both Reddit and Digg, any controversial item leaves public sight; only those items that most approve of reach and stay in the front. Those items only of great appeal to a subsection of the user base either fail to reach and stay in the top, and, as a result, simpler items with more general appeal begin to dominate the front.For Reddit; this was the rise of political articles; for Digg, which I am less familiar with, I\\'d imagine it involved less technically in-depth items.The above system accelerates; as content begins to represent the cross-section of the interests of a larger, more diverse group, the site attracts an even larger, even more-diverse group.The squashing of controversy and propagation of opinion combine so that commenting maintains a status quo: The posts that are upmodded are known to be upmodded, and, thus newcomers will associate these types of posts with being worthy of upmods and will upmod them themselves. Due to the desire for social status, those newcomers bold enough to begin making comments of their own attempt to imitate the style accepted by the community as \"upmod-worthy.\" And thus, newcomers learn to achieve a style that causes their posts to be upmodded.The above two points combine: The oldtimers tolerated newcomers; the newcomers tolerated newer-comers; due to the logistical nature of the system, each \"generation\" outnumbers the previous. The newer-comers whom the oldtimers indirectly \"let in\" may create comments repulsive to many of the oldtimers that get upmodded to the top; this slowly disillusions the relevant oldtimers, causing them to leave, solidifying the community\\'s shift.And there, that\\'s Digg, according to my understanding. I must admit I\\'ve used Digg little and do not have a firm grasp on how its system works, so everything I say about Digg should be taken with a grain of salt; on Reddit, I am more confident in my ability to speak truthfully.Reddit\\'s story goes further: In Reddit, a controversial item where one side has an advantage can reach the front page. Thus, assuming it involves the general cross section of readers, the ideology that originally had an upper hand will get its content to the front and the opposing ideologues, primarily reading items they disagree with, leave. The former ideology solidifies its hold; future opponents of said ideology get discouraged from joining; groupthink evolves.And thus, my theory for the state of Reddit today. Reddit\\'s original techie audience created the status quo of commenting style. They drew in their friends and peers from various communities via word of mouth. The new users tolerated and contributed to the technical articles that were reddit\\'s genesis; the techies tolerated and contributed to the nontechnical articles being brought in. The cycle occurred again, and, though the technical bias in the community was preserved through visible, active posters, a shift toward articles with broader appeal was well underway.  Since the original techie user base likely contained more liberals and libertarians than conservatives, the former two  ideologies, both of which involve laypeople and can be associated with most topics, began to heavily get their content into the front. Liberalism and libertarianism tolerate each other somewhat, but liberalism was stronger due to its numerical advantage among the general populace. The hold of liberalism expanded as outlined.As one might expect from the above paragraph, the front page of the Reddit of today has articles on healthcare, global warming, and other politicized material; some items supporting Ron Paul; and a whole bunch of items with broad but shallow appeal, such as pictures of cats.',\n",

This problem I\\'m particularly interested in.\\nThe idea that services like these attract the LCD is a result of their design and not of operation. I think it is possible to circumvent this problem, but you must change the design concept.I recently attended the Wikimania conference and they talked about the absurd complexity of the rules now applied to Wikipedia. The oldies were talking about \"back in the day\" just like the old diggers. Spawning a new Wikipedia-like system isn\\'t going to work; Citizendium is not the answer. You can spawn a new digg and it would still face the same problems. You can talk about spawning a new news.yc for non-startup content, and assuming it gets popular, it would still run into quality control problems. Plus, pg has a sizeable following, but there is only one of him: unless he clones himself for the new site, or creates a different system, his divested energy will result in one being less active than the other.A community news site that handles 10K users isn\\'t going to handle 1M users similarly just by scaling the system or by implementing friends and leaders. There\\'s that rule of 150 written in the Tipping Point book that says any group exceeding about 150 members will become difficult to manage(I shouldn\\'t cite Gladwell but it\\'s not an unfounded idea). A site of thousands of active members will, of course, run into management problems, but with a 10:90 active:lurker ratio, it works ok when your site has up to perhaps 20k users before you see any substantial, visible change in focus. Since not every user is active at the same time of day, you can increase the size of the virtual community, perhaps to something like 300 core members before the content changes dramatically.I don\\'t know digg\\'s numbers, but taking wikipedia as an example, with thousands of active editors, of course you will run into problems! And they think it\\'s a result of lack of consensus over what is acceptible behavior or something.Seems pretty obvious to me, and I welcome challengers.

In addition, when I go to a network site the landing page should be a video player playing whatever is being broadcast in my time zone at that moment. 1) Put TV on the internet.

The solution, if you agree with me that news should provide insight, is exceptional reporting, top-notch writing, and a variety of ideological viewpoints.

Furthermore, it makes long-term legal costs lower because most corporate lawyers are familiar with Delaware's nuances.All corporations are C by default.  You have to file a special from with the IRS to become an S Corporation.  S Corporations are flow-through entities which are not taxed at the corporate level.  The reason VCs require you to be a C Corporation is two-fold:1. VCs like to have unilateral rights and terms to give them downside protection such as liquidity preference and preferential stock classes such as Preferred Shares.  S Corporations are simpler entities which only allow a maximum of 40 shareholders - as your company grows and you give stock grants or options, this won't work.  LLCs only allow 75 shareholders.  2. VCs will claim that a C Corp structure gives you more flexibility.  This is marginally true, but LLCs give you the same flexibility with slightly higher administrative cost but you can maintain the flow-through status which is advantageous.The real reason is they want preferred shares and special rights.  Stay an LLC or S Corporation if you don't need institutional investors.  Angels are happy to invest in well structured LLCs or standard subchapter S Corporations.\",\n",

At all. It never has, and it never will. Those photos you took are pointless. If pictures are worth a thousand words, then people are worth a billion photos. A few photos a day just can't capture what you're thinking, the social context, the general mood, your thoughts and feelings, the state of the economy, foreign relations, what you just did 5 minutes prior, what you just ate, what your friends are up to off-camera, if the person next to you smells like they're drunk, the charge on your cell phone, your status with friends and family, etc.Photos give the illusion of defining you at a point in time, but they are NOT a virtual machine or an environment like Squeak--they're just a screen shot--and not what the person's doing, either, but what what's visible for that split second of time.The big problem, then, is that people judge themselves by what they would look like if somebody were to take a photo of them, and not by where they're going. In fact, people are doing everything they can to impede where they're going--buying anti-age cremes, spending money so they don't have to take the responsibility of saving it, which might otherwise make them feel older. So, people are always focusing on looking like they have never made any progress in their lives.However, when traveling through life--whether by car, aging, networking, degrees, promotions, dating)--it doesn't matter where you actually are. At all. It never has, and it never will.The only two things that matter are the direction and velocity. Therefore, you always have to make the best choices you can for your life, when buying things, socializing, and business. Look at what's stopping you, decide your options, and pick the best overall choice, and if you really can't see a better way, then do the option that is easier. Then move on. Life is better than any video game because you have infinite choices in infinite areas. The key is to hurry up and make a choice, and move on to the other 230 trillion choices you have.If you know you like a shirt, and the fit and price range is good, but you can't decide between red and blue, pick one randomly and move on.

In my last job, I was beginning to notice a similar wall, but more importantly it was fairly clear that management both did not enjoy working with technology, and did not enjoy managing employees within the framework of the company.  They did not enjoy dealing with bureaucracy, yet it was forced on them often.  This resulted in consistently poor morale.  Even when we thought morale was good, it was bad by the standards of the company I work fow now.

       " 'OK, here is some of the \"why\" of facebook for those of us who aren\\'t heavy users.Facebook is casual and useful. It\\'s easy to set up an event or fundraiser, invite everyone you know, put up pictures about the event, and so on. Many comments show that there are expectations for use cases that Facebook really isn\\'t about. \"Having hundreds of \\'friends\\' is pointless.\" \"...looking for dates...met someone interesting...\" That\\'s not what Facebook is about, nor intended to be.Yep, you can stay in touch with your close friends on Facebook if you really want. Many people do. But, it\\'s really about those hundreds of people you still care about, but you don\\'t see on a regular basis. It is the best way to keep tabs on them. It\\'s also great for setting plans with them. As a personal side note, Facebook has led to several happy reunions with old friends after I lost their contact information for years.More about the idea of \"Facebook is casual\". Facebook messages have injected themselves between email and IM on the formality spectrum, and wall posts are now between Messages and IM. You can initiate conversation with people who would otherwise find it odd. Like, say, members of the attractive sex. The common theme is that Facebook pleases our in-born psychological social instincts. It is a fine lesson in human factors. Yet more. The cool kids are on facebook. You know, the ones that we\\'re supposed to hate as self-respecting geeks, because we\\'re smarter but they somehow have more fun? That means people who care about being cool get on Facebook. (Although rebellion is cool, so now it\\'s cool to take a stand against Facebook and stay off. But that\\'s a whole other story.)It\\'s a perfectly acceptable social norm to \"Facebook-stalk\" someone: To look up their interests when you\\'re interested in them. That\\'s a big one. It\\'s a handy, casual way of passing around contact information. Once you know someone\\'s name and a little bit about them, you can find them on Facebook. You don\\'t need to ask for their phone number or IM or email address, find somewhere to write it down, and take 30 awkward seconds to do it. You just say, \"Let\\'s find each other on Facebook.\" To be clear: Facebook makes it just a little bit easier to pick up. Also, friending is a no-cost way of sending goodwill.So that\\'s why people use Facebook.People on this discussion board love news about Facebook because Facebook is every tech entrepreneur\\'s wet dream. Zuckerberg is young, modest, smart and very, very rich. Startup founders love to dream about Facebook-like success because that\\'s what they all want. It\\'s intellectual masturbation. When someone posts insights about Facebook\\'s success, instant nerdgasm. Also, Facebook is an important enough influence on mainstream digital life that few Web entrepreneurs can ignore it. Facebook app clones can kill fledgling independent applications fast. And if Facebook manages to get people used to spending money while on Facebook, they could rival Google, Amazon, and Ebay in importance. Finally, a note about the \\'stolen idea\\'. Let\\'s ignore that where the idea came from is irrelevant to Facebook\\'s current utility and success. You ought to realize that ideas are near-worthless and execution is everything. FB is a case study in excellent execution. They hire brilliant developers just like Joel says, and they built a very clean UI as a competitive advantage over Myspace. Nearly all successful businesses are based on incremental improvements on existing ideas with great execution. Put it this way: \"Online store\" is not terribly creative, but pg is rich and famous today because his gang of hackers had the best execution in building one. Search engines were not a new idea when Google took over the world. Nor were operating systems or word processors when Microsoft did before that. Online social networks were not new. They just sucked enough that there was room for Facebook to step in a build a better one.\\n',\n",

Clean, minimalist, and directs you to things you can do with it.It\\'s really nifty that you go straight from search results to a \"get new results by RSS\" link.  But add an e-mail option too!  It may seem hard to believe, but not everybody uses RSS, particularly outside of tech circles.  Keep the UI simple - just have someone enter an e-mail address and it\\'ll email you when a new group appears in your location.It\\'d be nice to be able to filter searches/subscriptions by keyword as well.  For example, I\\'m interested in startup &#38; programming groups in Boston.  I\\'d like to be able to say \"Show me all the startup organizations in Boston\", and if there are none, I want to be able to type in my e-mail address, get notified when new ones appear, and otherwise forget about the site.If you do this, you might want to show off popular subscriptions (location + keywords) on the front page.  Aside from indicating that people are listening for new groups, it also could show people what interests are hottest.  This could be a good signal for which groups people may want to start.I personally would not care all that much about message boards, at least not until the site gets a lot of traffic.

       " 'This also explains the Fine-Tuned Universe.An interesting property of a simulated brain is the simulation can take an arbitrarily long amount of time.  You can update in virtual \"Planck timesteps\", even if in real time this takes a million years.  Any simulated brain won\\'t be able to tell, because it doesn\\'t get any updates in between these steps.  Time becomes a property of the system you\\'re simulating...  Just like in reality.  It might take until the Sun goes Red Giant to run your single lifetime simulation.The speed of light is a convenience for updating the simulation in discrete steps.  Particle/wave duality \"deciding\" upon observation is just lazy evaluation, like in Haskell.  Quantum entanglement is no mystery when distance is virtual.  A Universe where the speed of light is a hard limit can still contain a simulated Universe where it isn\\'t.Why do we want virtual worlds?  Properly implemented and convincing, we can do away with suffering altogether.  We can \"live\" in a world that seems fully real, but in which no-one is actually suffering because everyone else is simulated.  All our needs are met and all our desires are fulfilled.The mistake we keep making is that in order to create convincing AIs to inhabit the world with us, they actually become as sentient and conscious as we are; being virtual is no barrier to feelings or emotions!  [1]Thus our creations want to create a simulation to live in themselves, so they won\\'t suffer, either, and so it goes like a perpetual zoom on a fractal set.[1] To convince yourself of this, consider a matter replicator that copies every single atom in your body.  You\\'d create a clone.  It would be thinking and feeling just as you do.  Now consider a computer simulation of a single atom; if that can be done, then by extension, it would be possible to simulate anything made of atoms.  A simulated clone of you would also behave the same.  The neurological activity that occurs in your \"real\" brain when you feel or think would also occur across the virtual atoms in the brain of your virtual clone.  In fact, that would involve real electrical activity taking place among real atoms making up the RAM chips and CPUs \"containing\" the simulation of the virtual clone.  Thus any simulation at the same scope or nesting level as yourself is as real as you are and therefore its feelings are just as valid. [2][2] By further extension, if your simulations are as real as you are, then your simulation\\'s simulations are as real as it is, and thus a simulation at any nesting level is as real as one at any other -- a simulation inside a simulation is still running on real atoms with real electricity!\\n',\n",

If you think about it, it's obviously impractical to simulate an entire universe within the universe itself.In our parent universe, this wouldn't be an issue. Their speed of light must be faster, their atoms smaller.

Hunter-gatherers still had and have tribal wars, murder, rape, rapine, torture, high infant mortality, much lower male life expectancy (due to fighting), plus the usual disease, famine, and social inequality of women.The average college student in a dorm room enjoys greater luxury and comfort than kings of yesteryear; they have climate control, hot and cold running water, antibiotics, corrective eyewear, and of course a far greater selection of food year-round, not to mention a better selection of healthy mates.Whether people are happier in modern technological society or hunter-gatherer society is almost beside the point; evolution seems to have selected for worried, discontented people -- they outcompete the easily satiated.  Even as we precipitate the extinction of traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyles, we can imagine them at some point in the past wiping out even less technologically-savvy people who perhaps were even more happy and contented, leading an existence akin to our bonobo relatives.  A similar article written then by gatherers might blame the widespread adoption of hunting for increasing societal violence and leading to a new class division: warrior, due to the ensuing upswing in human-human \"hunting\".Increased population can be thought of as a tool; it has been exploited for ill much of the time, but it can also be used for the betterment of all.

So somehow you\\'ve got to condense the myriad of different cultures, beliefs and desires into a single reality.  Governments have relied on various ways of accomplishing this:1.) Kill everyone who doesn\\'t agree with the \"official\" culture.  Eg. Rwanda, Bosnia, Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, U.S. conquest of Native Americans2.) Kill the most vocal proponents of alternate viewpoints, enough to terrorize the remaining citizens into keeping with the party line.  Eg. modern Russia, several South American governments, apartheid South Africa3.) Convince the population that eternal damnation awaits anyone who disagrees with the party line.  Eg. the Catholic Church4.) Split the population into many little populations, each of which can have their own reality.  Eg. former Yugoslavia, former Soviet Union, American Civil War, Roman Empire.  Problem with this is that each sub-state still wants to impose its reality upon its neighbors, so you often get continual warfare until one gobbles up the others.5.) Convince a majority of the population that they really agree with you.  This is the \"discrimination and brainwashing\" you refer to.6.) Develop some fundamental principles that everybody agrees on, then agree to disagree on the specifics, knowing that eventually reality will come swing your way.  Eg. the Enlightenment theory behind liberty and democracy#6 seems to be the ideal, but it requires some cognitive dissonance, namely the ability to say \"I disagree with what you\\'re doing, but will defend your right to do it.\"  Most people are not capable of this kind of cognitive dissonance - either they slip into \"I will not defend your right to do this\" and end up with #1 or #2, or they slip into \"I agree with what you\\'re doing\" and end up with #5.So #5 is the most stable system that a large civilization can enter.  Most Western democracies actually function as a combination of #5 and #6, with the masses adjusting their beliefs to fit their leaders and the leaders themselves agreeing to disagree under fundamental principles.  U.S. democracy is currently in danger because a disturbing number of \"leaders\" (on both sides) are suggesting #1 or #3, but the political party system is meant to encourage #6.Incidentally, the same problem happens with multi-party governments.

One viable way out of such dominance is some form of party-list proportional representation (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_represe...) .The second is all about psychology, it most certainly has several components at play.  I posit the most prevalent are attitudes of commitment given the initial choice of party and some form of path of least resistance.The former is common in psychology.  It is a natural instinct to think your group is better as soon as you join it, for whatever reason, even an arbitrary one.  This even happens in psychology experiments when groups are assigned randomly.  The latter reason is simply most people don't research any issues nor do they want to.  They go with perhaps the simplest method to decide, which is listen to what the group told me before.  There is some real trade-off here.  To be fully informed is perhaps impossible.  You need some sort of proxy for most policy issues.  Blindly following one of two major parties (on the other extreme) is probably not the answer either of course.\",\n",

I think I\\'ll manage to piss off both the Austrian school mises.org Libertarians and the I-always-get-screwed-by-corporations Liberals.Free markets work when they transmit information with each transaction.  When a factory owner raises his prices to cover rising costs, he\\'s encapsulating information about everything that\\'s happened further up the value chain.  When a shopkeeper lowers the price he\\'s willing to pay, he\\'s encapsulating information about consumer demand and everything downstream in the value chain.  If a new means of production becomes available that\\'s more efficient than the old one, there\\'s a profit opportunity available for the aspiring entrepreneur.  And everybody has an incentive to pass on correct information, because otherwise it\\'s their own bank account that will suffer.  This appears to be the only way to organize an economy efficiently.Free markets fail when transactions conceal information.  For example, many subprime loans were made to people who had no conceivable way of paying them off, but mortgage brokers had every incentive to hide that information from the hedge funds who bought them, and didn\\'t have to shoulder the risk of default themselves.  Health-care patients have no way of knowing whether a particular procedure is medically necessary and no incentive to find out, because the insurance company pays for it.  Microsoft customers had no way of knowing whether Windows is the best OS, because there were no alternatives (well, except Apple and Linux...pretend this is 1997 or so).There\\'s also the issue of transaction costs - it costs nearly as much money to collect tolls as it does to just build the damn highway, so the \"information\" that the customer sees is heavily distorted by the process of having to collect that information.So, based on this, I can derive some general principles for the role of government:1.) It should provide the institutional framework necessary for the market to function at all, eg. contract laws and defense.2.) It should rectify the \"lemon problem\", where sellers conceal vital information from buyers or vice-versa, eg. consumer protection laws, implied warranties, truth-in-advertising laws, full disclosure on mortgages, SEC regulation, etc.3.) It should prevent companies from leveraging a monopoly to enter a market.4.) It should rectify externalities, where a firm takes something of value to others but doesn\\'t pay for it, usually because it\\'s too difficult to arrange a transaction.  The classic example is pollution.5.) It should provide goods and services where the transaction cost of attempting to measure and restrict usage is greater than the actual value of the service.  Markets will never develop in these areas otherwise.  A good example would be roads.Some concrete examples, which\\'ll probably seem kinda out-there:To start, I wouldn\\'t have any taxes at all.  Instead, the government owns all land, and raises revenue by auctioning off leases on land, natural resources, and pollution credits.  These leases would be tradable, subdividable securities, and would be subject to normal SEC prohibitions on disclosure and insider trading.  If you wanted to construct a skyscraper that you expect to last 50 years, you\\'d buy a 50-year lease on the land.  If you ended up selling it after 20, you could sell the lease on the open market, but the land itself would revert back to the government after another 30 years.  The government can also buy the lease back by paying market rates.This helps the externality problem, because every time the voters want to prevent something like a polluting factory, they have the legal ability to, but they also have a precise dollar figure for how much it\\'ll cost, in economic terms.  If people don\\'t want oil companies to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they can simply block the lease on drilling rights, but it will cost them a few billion dollars.  Then they can decide whether the economic value to oil companies is worth more than the government services they will receive from it.As for spending itself - roads are an obvious one, because the transaction costs of tolls are hellish.  Defense is another one - I don\\'t think we need to spend quite so much as we do, but we do need a strong military.I would not provide free education, other than the basic literacy and civic requirements necessary for democracy to function.  You tend to get what you pay for.  Free education not only leads to bureacratic, uncaring schoolboards, but it also leads to freeriding, uncaring schoolchildren.  Instead, I\\'d create rigorous public evaluations of all schools - not necessarily tests (which generally reflect the politicians\\' biases more than actually useful information), but statistics about where graduates end up, satisfaction levels, evaluations from past students, etc.  Then let people choose - and spend their own money - on schools.  Since people shouldn\\'t be denied education based on what their parents do, there should be loans available - but through the private sector, not public.  Also, education has a problem in that it takes years for it to pay off, and market conditions can change dramatically between when you enter and when you exit.  To insure against this, I\\'d create a tradable derivative called \"salary futures\" (again through the private sector).  This is not insurance on your salary (that would have a huge moral hazard problem), but rather a promise to pay the change in the difference between the average salaries of two professions.  These can be bundled into funds if necessary, to diversify across the whole economy.  So if you want to become an engineer but find that salaries have gone way down by the time you graduate, your salary future will kick in with the difference for X number of years, and then you can decide whether to stick with it or retrain as a lawyer.Health care is tricky because nobody wants to die, and if life really is priceless, then people should be willing to pay infinite amounts of money to avoid dying.  Markets aren\\'t meant to deal with infinities. I\\'d need to think about this; I suppose if I actually came up with a workable solution I\\'d be rich and famous and wouldn\\'t be posting it on a glorified message board. ;-)',\n",
       " 'An interesting point on healthcare:  can you name the major turning point from the days of old when doctors made house calls to today?  It is the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, which permanently distorted the entire health care market.  The government is very much involved with our health care system, and the result is growing trouble in health care.  Adding more regulation will make it worse - history makes this point quite clearly.I think government should provide our National Defense, the Justice System, and Police.',\n",
       " 'First of all, there isn\\'t much of a free market in health care. There is much regulation, and the current model of requiring corporations give their employees health insurance is flawed. Contrarywise, prices have fallen in cosmetic surgery, the only medical field mostly left to the free market.(And where did you get the entire that free education means government education? There have been free schools in America since before there was a country called \"America.\")Second of all, an economically free society would likely have taxes nowhere near 25%. That\\'s higher than Hong Kong\\'s income tax today, and much higher than America\\'s income tax when income tax was legalized.I\\'ve decided that the bare minimum of government that must be had are the courts (and the power to enforce their rulings). A libertarian society will be highly dependent on contracts; society could not function if you knew a powerful client could refuse to pay and ignore court rulings. I have trouble visualizing a fair, for-profit court system. If competing court systems exist, then how is the court system for a case chosen? Presumably, it would be spelled out in the contract, which gives a perpetual advantage to the vendor. Of course, the buyer could ignore the summons, but said court could force him to arrive and would then rule that it was justified doing so (as it was).Everything that is not a court can belong to the free market, but that does not mean should. For example, you could purchase the privilege to drive on one company\\'s network of roads, but, barring some major advances in scanning technology and some means of stopping trespassers,  the need to enforce that only paid cars use the road would be extraordinarily cumbersome. The best private road system I could see would be to have a monopoly on roads in every region; road companies could then make deals with neighbors for interregional traffic and coerce developments into requiring residents to pay the road company, at the risk of having the road company block access to the development. However, I\\'m not sure I can trust a private monopoly more than a government monopoly.Law enforcement is also a good candidate for government control; however, private police forces are not out of the question. There would probably be less overhead to hire police to protect an area rather than individuals, so police might not necessarily turn a blind eye to a homeless man getting mugged (not to mention that said criminal should be caught for the same reason Animal Control kills animals becoming accustomed to attacking humans). However, a system where every five feet is patrolled by a police force with different opinions of what an arrestable offense is is hardly ideal.Fire protection, another commonly cited candidate for government control, could actually work pretty well privately. A computer can easily check whether a certain building is protected, and the benefits of competition will result.

Today's OSes were largely built for a disconnected world - the 'my machine is an island' scenario - which isn't necessarily the case today.The pertinent question is: where do today's systems fail us in an always or often-connected world?  Maybe you'd work on the networking stack, providing services that made transferring between connections as seamless as possible (hopping from public wi-fi to 3G to WiMax, and prioritizing traffic based on network bandwidth and costs).  Maybe we change filesystems to better support synchronization - for example, build in better change tracking so that we can synchronize using the minimum amount of bandwidth.  Maybe you'd look for ways to be able to transfer the state of your applications, so you can work on one machine, and then continue working on your phone, then on your hotel TV, then back to the original machine.  What about collaboration and communication?  How can we build applications that seamlessly combine web information with local information (maybe even blurring the difference)?  Not everything belongs in the OS, but the supporting functionality certainly does.None of these ideas are particularly new, but today's software stack is in need of some pretty serious evolution to get the most out of the promise of a connected world.

I'm not seeing enough of the hypothesis-testing approach that is the cornerstone of real science.I don't want to seem like I'm being too hard on the guy.  After all, some questions just can't be approached this way.  We can measure the effectiveness of a new drug on blood pressure through hypothesis and testing, but it would be very difficult, maybe impossible, to use this approach to determine why the first world war was fought.  Sometimes you just have to go back through the facts and construct a plausable case.  But it isn't science anymore.Aside from that, I agree (for what it's worth) with much of what he has to say, but I still think he has understated the degree of exclusion women have experienced from male networks.  It's really damaging.Suppose that it's true, as the author stated, that men are more likely than women to be wired for risk.  Sounds reasonable enough.  But that might still mean that for every 5 people with the ability and inclination do do something risky (say, found a startup), 4 are male and one is female.  But the way males form networks often excludes the women - even in the modern day.  I don't think it's on purpose, and there's rarely any malice, but it's just as damaging.  You generally pick friends for your startup.  The people you get drunk with, stay up all night completing the compiler class with, cram into a hotel room in vegas with... and you tend to do these things with close friends who are almost always other guys.  If 4/5 are guys, then the odds that a man will find like-minded buddies is much higher than it is for women.  I double majored in Math and English.  It was a trip.  I'd count the ratio of men to women in each class, and it was usuall between 5:1 and 10:1.  And in the math class (sorry to say it), many of the women were planning on becoming math teachers.  This means that the women with the ability and inclination to do startups have to break into the boys club or they'll be left in the cold.  So far, they're usually left in the cold.  If this weren't the case, I have no doubt we'd see far more women in fields that require a high degree of risk, creativity, and collaboration.     \\n\",\n",

As long as a founder is in charge, the CEO is working with the corporate culture.  When an outside manager is brought in, he usually ends up working against corporate culture.In every company I\\'ve worked in, the culture was essentially a reflection of the founder\\'s personality.  If there are multiple founders, it reflects a weird amalgam of all the ones that are involved in the daily business.  If an early employee tends to run things in the early days, the culture reflects them as much as the founders.  Think Intel and Andy Grove, or 3M and William McKnight.Companies tend to inherit both the best qualities and worst faults of their founders.  However, their position in the marketplace usually reflects the best qualities.  After all, nobody buys from a company for what it sucks at.An outsider brings his own strengths and weaknesses to the company, but it\\'s very unlikely that his strengths will line up with the culture and market that the company already has.  Think John Sculley and Apple - great executive for cola, not so great for computers.  The founder, instead, may have tons of liabilities, but at least he won\\'t be fighting the corporate culture he himself has created.There\\'s some evidence to back this up, for instance:1.) It echoes the findings in Good to Great: the turnaround process involves applying the \"hedgehog principle\" of asking yourself what the company is really passionate about, then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus, and only then changing strategy.  The hedgehog principle is essentially a question about culture: where does the culture of this organization fit into the overall economy.  Then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus consists of strengthening the positive aspects of the company culture and weakening the negative ones.2.) In cases where an outside turnaround CEO has successfully turned around a company, they usually spend a significant amount of time acclimatizing themselves to the existing culture, and only start changing things after they already \"fit in\".  Think Lou Gerstner and IBM.  Even then, they often make decisions that mortgage the long-term health of the company by destroying the previous cultural values.  Gerstner eliminated IBM\\'s status as an R&#38;D powerhouse, for example, while James McNerney nearly destroyed 3M\\'s innovation culture with Six Sigma.3.) Companies that survive the departure of their founders usually do so by institutionalizing their culture as a set of company values, bringing in fresh recruits out of college before they\\'ve been able to pick up a different corporate culture, and then promoting from within to put in place management who already understands the existing culture.  Think GE.  ',\n",

Of course, because no successor has as large a stake in it as the original founder.  Maybe they should do it like a kingship, slightly modified -- where the successor inherits HALF of the founder\\'s equity.  You would stand a much better chance of attracting the best people if they were going to get the billions when you stepped down -- subject to vesting and performance.  Why would the top people want to join an existing company when the big equity has already been taken out of it?So, when you retire you vest half of the Founder\\'s stock, if you\\'ve been there \"long enough\".  Take a company from $10B market cap to $20B and you\\'ve doubled the Founder\\'s share, so you get an amount equal to what the whole thing was when you started, and leave an equal amount to lure the next CEO.It\\'s late so I may well be missing obvious flaws in the scheme, but some kind of equity retention strategy seems to be needed to promote long-term vitality because the current m.o. is the original founders and investors bleed it all out.\\n',\n",

The terms sheet would be essentially a non-binding high-level agreement to the basic terms of the deal.  Price is just one of many terms.  It is clearly one of the important ones, but there are other sometimes equally important terms in a given deal, such as associated non-compete and consulting contracts.  Also, \"price\" is a nebulous term and is usually not just one isolated number.  For instance, there can be earn-outs, hold-backs, escrowed amounts, consulting fees, etc., and all of these can be tied to indemnities, conditions, etc.  And the structure of the deal, e.g. stock vs asset, impacts the net take home to the shareholders, which is what most people are ultimately interested in.Both parties agree on the terms sheet through negotiation.  That sounds obvious, but the point is there is not one set process.  There are many strategies to negotiation and some make more sense than others in the context of a particular deal.  It is not uncommon for parties to walk away and come back to the table at this stage, and in fact, at all stages.  The \"price\" could easily move up or down significantly depending on a number of factors.  It really comes down to what the seller is willing to sell for and what the buyer is willing to buy for.  If there is an overlap, there could be a deal.  If not, then no deal.  The rest is jockeying for the overlap.  Walking away until you get x is one tactic to get to the top of the overlap from your perspective.Finally, investment bankers and their equivalents in these situations are not necessary, but they can get you a higher price.  Their basic usefulness is connecting you to potential buyers, i.e. through their roladex.  You, alone, may not know or have access to these potential buyers.  By engaging multiple buyers you can get an auction scenario, which is often ideal because usually buyers willing to pay more for something if they are taking it away from someone else in addition to getting it for themselves.  However, certain tactics can turn off and ultimately dislodge particular buyers from the process, which could be net negative for the shareholders depending on which buyer(s) walked away.
